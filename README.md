🚀 October Daily LeetCode Challenges 2024
Welcome to my repository where I tackle daily coding challenges on LeetCode throughout October 2024! 💻 This is part of my continuous learning journey to sharpen my problem-solving skills, especially with algorithms and data structures.

📅 Goal
I am solving one LeetCode problem daily and pushing my solutions to this repository. This keeps me consistent with coding and provides an archive of solutions for future reference.

🧑‍💻 Problem-Solving Approach
I read the problem statement carefully.
Break down the problem into smaller steps.
Come up with a strategy (e.g., brute-force, optimization).
Code the solution in JavaScript.
Analyze time and space complexity.
Optimize if necessary and test against edge cases.
📂 Repository Structure
Each day has its own folder named Day_X (where X is the day number).
Each folder contains:
Solution.js: JavaScript solution for the problem.
Problem.md: A markdown file with the problem statement and approach.
